## üìã Package Dependencies

Some packages have dependencies on others. Install them in the following order for best results:

### **For Character Control Systems:**

1. **Design Patterns** (foundation)
2. **Third Person Control** (basic character controller)
3. **WitActor** (advanced actor system) - *depends on Third Person Control*

### **For API Integration:**

1. **API Integration** (standalone - no dependencies)

### **Cinemachine Dependency:**

The **Third Person Control** and **WitActor** packages require **Cinemachine**:

1. Open **Window ‚Üí Package Manager**
2. Switch to **Unity Registry**
3. Search for "Cinemachine"
4. Click **Install**

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Setup Guides

### **Third Person Control Setup**

After installing the package:

1. Select your character GameObject in the hierarchy
2. Go to **WitShells ‚Üí ThirdPersonSetup ‚Üí Setup ThirdPerson Character**
3. The setup will automatically:
   - Add required components (CharacterController, ThirdPersonControl)
   - Configure the animator with locomotion controller
   - Create camera target and setup Cinemachine camera
   - Add CinemachineBrain to Main Camera

### **WitActor Setup**

The WitActor package extends Third Person Control:

1. First complete the Third Person Control setup
2. Add WitActor components as needed for advanced behaviors
3. Configure the locomotion state machine for complex character actions

### **API Integration Setup**

1. Go to **WitShells ‚Üí API Integration ‚Üí API Test Window**
2. Define your API endpoints and test them directly in the editor
3. Use the generated code in your runtime scripts
